glsl-canvas specifics:
-won't let you declare the version
-uniform names: https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer/wiki/GlslViewer-UNIFORMS
-vec4 gl_FragCoord and vec4 gl_FragColor are the in/out variables
-gl_FragCoord will let you access (at least) x,y. you can access more letters but I have no idea what they signify
-main can take no arguments

vec4 (red,green,blue,alpha), where 1 is maximum
MUST explicitly make every number a float. super annoying.
fragcoord and fragcolor are not uniforms because they vary by pixel. uniforms are constant per pixel.
